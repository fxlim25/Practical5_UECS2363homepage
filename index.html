		UTAR Kampar Campus

		UTAR’s main campus in Kampar was built on a 1300-acre piece of land donated by the Perak State Government. It is
		located in the growing township of Bandar Barat Kampar in Perak. Strategically located off the North-South
		highway, Kampar Campus is 190 km from Kuala Lumpur which is slightly over two hours away from the city by car.
		The Campus welcomed its first intake of students in May 2007.

		Flanked by picturesque mountains, dotted with scenic lakes and located within a growing township, Kampar Campus
		offers a conducive and serene learning environment. This Campus features modern educational facilities and
		provides students with access to some of the latest learning technologies and research innovations. In addition,
		the Campus has facilities for sports such as football, basketball, volleyball, badminton, table tennis and a
		gymnasium. The spacious campus grounds are also ideal for jogging and cycling.

		The following faculties are located in UTAR Kampar Campus:

		Faculty of Arts and Social Science (FAS)
		Faculty of Business and Finance (FBF)
		Faculty of Engineering and Green Technology (FEGT)
		Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (FICT)
		Faculty of Science (FSc)
		Centre for Foundation Studies (CFS Kampar)
		Centre for Extension Education (CEE Kampar)
		Institute of Chinese Studies (ICS Kampar)
		The construction of Phase Two of the Kampar campus was completed in mid- 2012. With the completion of Phase Two,
		there are now 15 buildings in this lake-view campus including a grand hall with a seating capacity of 4,000,
		lecture theatres, tutorial rooms, a cafeteria, and the creation of more parking spaces.

		Visitors to the panoramic UTAR Kampar Campus will unmistakably catch a glimpse of the exceptionally striking
		grand hall erected with architectural finesse on a 12,000-square metre plot of land. This palatial hall was
		built to commemorate UTAR's 10th anniversary and it was named after its illustrious founder, YABhg Tun Dr Ling
		Liong Sik who is now the Chancellor of UTAR.

		Another unique feature in Kampar Campus is a pair of bronze sculptures; one of Confucius and the other of
		Einstein. These two imposing sculptures are located in front of Heritage Hall and weigh a total of 580kg. These
		sculptures symbolise UTAR's belief in the universality of learning and thinking with the convergence of wisdoms
		from both the East and the West.

		Amid the lush greenery and pristine lakes on campus is the UTAR Bird Sanctuary which is a heronry located on a
		small island in the middle of the lake on campus. There are about 5 species of herons breeding in this heronry.
		Besides these breeding birds, the campus is also surveyed to have an impressive 100 species of birds.

		UTAR Sungai Long Campus

		The Sungai Long Campus is located in Bandar Sungai Long, a main township in Kajang, Selangor. It is a
		purpose-built campus with surrounding facilities and services that support banking, housing, public transport,
		shopping and meals for the convenience of the students.

		On 1 June 2015, UTAR relocated its campuses and offices from Setapak, Kuala Lumpur and Section 13 Petaling Jaya
		to its own campus in Sungai Long in a move to consolidate and strengthen the University’s presence in the Klang
		Valley. This move to Sungai Long was one of the most defining moments in UTAR’s history as the University
		continues its next decade of excellence in education.

		The Sungai Long Campus houses the Mary KUOK Pick Hoo Library and the following faculties, centres and
		institutes:

		Faculty of Accountancy and Management (FAM)
		Faculty of Medicine and Health Science (FMHS)
		Faculty of Creative Industries (FCI)
		Lee Kong Chian Faculty of Engineering and Science (LKC FES)
		Institute of Chinese Studies (ICS)
		Centre for Foundation Studies (CFS)
		Centre for Extension Education (CEE)
		Institute of Management and Leadership Development
		Institute of Postgraduate Studies and Research
